- Total state space dimension = OHLC features + Indicator features + Holding/Balance features + Strategy signal feature
  -                              = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1
  -                              = 11
- Discrete Features need to be encoded using one-hot encoding before feeding, current holding(long, short no position into (e.g., [1, 0, 0]), short (e.g., [0, 1, 0]), or no position (e.g., [0, 0, 1]).
- *Feature Selection:* Analyze the importance of each feature. Irrelevant features can increase the state space size without adding value, making learning computationally expensive.
- *Normalization/Scaling:* Ensure all features are on a similar scale to prevent bias towards features with larger ranges.
  - StandardScaler: StandardScaler is used when data distribution is bell-curve (e.g. Stock Return)
  - MinMaxScaler: Is used when the data distribution does not follow the bell curve (e.g. Stock price distribution)
- Feature Engineering:
  - Alpha Signal 
  - Beta Signal
  - TA Indicator addition

  - Balance
  - Holding
  - Alpha, Beta Signal
  - OHLCV
  - Index
- Action Space:
  - Buy, Sell, Hold
  - Short/Long

- FRED API will be used to fetch the interest rate data, which will further preprocess. [FRED Link](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikey)
- Micro FlowChart for Project flow [Miro Chart](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKH21GtA=/)
- To enhance the state Space, we will use the momentum single and mean-reversion single
  - In the Strategy folder, we have added the hqm.py file that finds the high-quality momentum stock out of given stocks
  - Then, we choose the stock that has high-quality momentum.
