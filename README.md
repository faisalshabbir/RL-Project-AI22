- Total state space dimension = OHLC features + Indicator features + Holding/Balance features + Strategy signal feature
  -                              = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1
  -                              = 11
- Discrete Features need to be encoded using one-hot encoding before feeding, current holding(long, short no position into (e.g., [1, 0, 0]), short (e.g., [0, 1, 0]), or no position (e.g., [0, 0, 1]).
- *Feature Selection:* Analyze the importance of each feature. Irrelevant features can increase the state space size without adding value, making learning computationally expensive.
- *Normalization/Scaling:* Ensure all features are on a similar scale to prevent bias towards features with larger ranges.
  - StandardScaler: StandardScaler is used when data distribution is bell-curve (e.g. Stock Return)
  - MinMaxScaler: Is used when data distribution is not follow the bell-curve (e.g. Stock price distribution)
